<h1 align="center">Nabi ðŸ¦‹</h1>

## Purpose
Nabi was made with the purpose of being completely free and accessable for servers. Most bots require you to pay money 
in order to use their more advanced features. However, most servers cannot afford these features in other bots, so 
Nabi was made! 

Nabi is completely free, featuring no microtransactions or other paid features. Nabi is also dedicated towards the 
open sourced initiative, making it so anyone can see and utilize portions of our own code in their respective bots.
