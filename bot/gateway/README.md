# Gateway
Nabi's custom gateway used for processing events and custom message commands.

## Why?
Since we use webserver interactions, we technically don't have a very pressing need for it. However, since we 
are still relying on Discord's Gateway for processing events, we need to supply Nabi a gateway.
