# Nabi's Terms of Service
**Last Updated: 19/9/2024**

By using any services in relation to Nabi, you agree to both the [Discord Terms and Services]() and 
our related terms of service. You agree that breaking any terms will result in complete termination of your ability to use
any services related to Nabi. You may also be blacklisted from any services from Nabi at any time for no given reason by 
the discression of the developers.

You may contact Nabi's developers with the following resources:
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/42da8JWwKa)

## Age Elligibility
You must be at least 13 years or older to use Nabi and her services, or have explicit permission from your parent or guardian. 
If you are under the age of 13, we have the right to terminate you from our services in compliance with the 
Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), as well as violating Discord's Terms of Service. We kindly request you to 
not use any of Nabi's services if so. 

Nabi, and her developers respectively, have the right to terminate your usage of her services if you are under the age 
of 13.

## Privacy
Nabi and her developers take your privacy seriously. **Nabi will only collect data that she deems necessary.** This includes:

* Guild Data (Servers)
* Member Data 
* User Data (i.e. profile picture, discriminator, username)
* Channel Data
* Role Data

See (../docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for more information.

## Legal
> [!NOTE]
> This currently only applies to code licensed under the GNU AGPL License. Code licensed under the current Polyform Shield
> 1.0.0 License specifically state that you cannot compete, meaning that you cannot profiteer off of the work of Nabi
> and her developers.

Nabi and her developers require you to specify the license if you utilize any form of our source code in your project. Nabi
is intentionally open-source to an extent to encourage people to develop upon the bot. 

## Noncompete & License Compliance
Nabi was purely made source available for both security, transparency, and being completely free. We understand that 
users may be reluctant to adopt Nabi and her services due to a lack of transparency, thus opening her source code for 
people to analyze.

For any and all services of Nabi's license which are labeled under the Polyform Shield 1.0.0 license or any non-compete 
related licenses, you agree to not compete with her services, and agree to not profiteer off of the work from her developers.
You agree to follow the license of whatever the subproject/project is licensed under. You are to assume projects without
any given/provided licenses are All Rights Reserved (ARR), and thus fall under our jurisdiction. Failure to comply may 
result in the possible invokation of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA).

> [!NOTE]
> This agreement will change when Nabi enters a stable release, instead using AGPL-3.0 for her license. This will only 
> apply to her bot, not any other related components. We will remove the noncompete term once AGPL-3.0 or another license
> is pushed.

## Access & Noncompliance
You agree to not harm any and all services in relation to Nabi, and agree that your ability to use Nabi may be removed at
any time.
