# Contributing
Contributions are always welcomed by the Nabi team.

## Building and Running Nabi
Nabi requires the following dependencies:

* Java 17 (Discord InteraKTions require it for webserver based interactions.)
* Redis/Any Redis compatible in memory database (Required by [`subprojects/cache`](../subprojects/cache))
* PostgreSQL (Required by [`subprojects/database`](../subprojects/database), though you can swap this out.)
* An HTTP server (*Optional*, although if you want other users to access Nabi's servers and websites, you'll need to specify this.)
